# Paul-VZ
An emulator for the 8-bit VZ200/300 Computer. Written in C#

Text mode, graphics mode, extended graphics, Save and load .vz files, disk image files.
Sound is not quite there yet... You can turn it off in the menu.

Various debugging tools are included as I created this as a programming exercise and to satisfy my curiousity about how VZ-200 and VZ-300 machines work internally. The VZ-300 was my first computer way back.

Why C#? Because I am more familiar with it than other languages, and because I can. It's not as unperformant as you would expect. The first iteration of this project was in Visual Basic.
