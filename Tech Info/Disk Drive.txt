Disk format:

Reading:
Port 0x10 is written to, with Drive 1 or 2 active. The stepper motor is controlled by sequencing bits 0-3. Bit is kept high.

Bit 0 - 3 : stepper motor
Bit 4 : Drive 1 Active (1=active)
Bit 5 : Write Data
Bit 6 : Write Request. Enable? (0=Active)
Bit 7 : Drive 2 Active (1=active)

As long as the Drive active bit is high, the disk spins (85rpm). This means the entire track passes over the read head continuously every 700ms.

Example Startup sequence (step in to ensure at Track 0:)
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 61 = 01100001 - no drive selected, write disabled.
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 71 = 01110001 - Drive 1 selected. Step 1
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 79 = 01111001 - Step 2
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 78 = 01111000 - Step 3
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 7C = 01111100 - Step 4
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 74 = 01110100 - Step 5
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 76 = 01110110 - Step 6
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 72 = 01110010 - Step 7
Port Write: Addr 0010, value: 73 = 01110011 - Step 8

The emulated hardware tracks stepper motor movement by looking for sequences on bit 0 - 3: 1,9,8 = Step in, 8,9,1 = Step 8.

Port 0x12 Bit 7 (0x80) is stobed every time a bit is received. The data is shifted into a register which is read on port 0x11.

The emulated hardware simply toggles 0x12 between 0x80 and 0x00, ie every time the emulated software checks, it sees a new bit available. The location in the disk image file is incremented by 1 each time. value provided on port 0x11 is referenced by this value /8.

The emualted hardware keeps track of the head movements to emualte the track position. The location in the file is therefore. TrackNo * TrackLength + (LocationOnTrack / 8)
